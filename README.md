# mmm - Minecraft with Modifications Manager on Command Line Interface

Minecraft is a popular game with many players.
It is also a game with many modifications("mods").
In order to manage it, many GUI tools are developed like [Hello Minecraft! Launcher](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL).
But skillful Linux Command Line Interface("CLI") users may not get used to GUI tools.
That's the reason of the birth of this tool.
By the way, this tool is similar to apt.
